    <h5 style="font-size:160%;">Future Plans</h5>
  <p>Starting the school year of 2017-2018 I will be doing a program that is called Running Start in which I will go and take college classes and high school classes at the same time. Doing so will make me be able to graduate with both my high school diploma and my AA degree. Ultimately decreasing two years of university. I will be 20 when I graduate unviversity, so 2 years earlier than the rest of my class year. Once I graduate I will apply to medical school and follow the path of a Doctor.</p>
    <h6 style="font-size:160%;">Conditionals</h6>
    <img src=Conditional.PNG" style="width:60px;height=60px;">
  <P>A conditional is kind of something that will cause a reaction to an action.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    <h7 style="font-size:160%;">Variable</h7>
    <img src=Variable.PNG" style="width:60px;height=60px;">
  <p>A variable is basically the thing that stores the information that is being put.</p>
    <h8 style="font-size:160%;">Function</h8>
    <img src=Function.PNG" style="width:60px;height=60px;">
  <p>A function is the process of performing a certiain task.
    <h9 style="font-size:160%;">Loop</h9>
    <img src=Loop.PNG" style="width:60px;height=60px;">
    <p>A loop is what repeats the actions.</p>
    <p>Something that I learned about circuits that I did not know before is how to connect the sound to it. My favorite part of the robot dance is when we finished. Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need things such as sensors for their robots.</p>
    <p>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard try to make their robots help people with their everyday life. My team worked well to create the lightshow and could have improved by thinking about how much time we have and manage our time well. It needs a microcontroller, and inputs/outputs.</p>
    <p>I would like to add sushi on my django site somehow. Although I am not sure how but I would like to include it in some way.</p>
