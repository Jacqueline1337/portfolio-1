    <h5 style="font-size:160%;">Future Plans</h5>
  <p>Starting this school year I will be doing a program that is called Running Start in which I will go and take college classes and high school classes at the same time. Doing so will make me be able to graduate with both my high school diploma and my AA degree. Ultimately decreasing two years of University. I will be 20 when I graduate Unviversity, so 2 years earlier than the rest of my class year. Once I graduate I will apply to medical school and follow the path of a Doctor.

    <img src=Conditional.PNG" style="width:60px;height=60px;">
  <P>A conditional is kind of something that will cause a reaction to an action.
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
    <h7 style="font-size:160%;">Variable</h7>
    <img src=Variable.PNG" style="width:60px;height=60px;">
  <p>A variable is basically the thing that stores the information that is being put.

  <P>My idea of robots changed a little bit today(7/17/17) as I now consider more objects as a robot. I am excited to find out how robots will evolve and impact people's lives. While working in groups we tried to make the LED light turn on and succeeded in the end. We made mistakes and found out that the reason that it would not light up was because the battery died. Something we learned was to check the battery.
  <P>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard try to make their robots help people with their everyday life. My team worked well to create the lightshow and could have improved by thinking about how much time we have and manage our time well. It needs a microcontroller, and inputs/outputs.
